Often in examples I've seen the intermediation is\r\nnot a network but a mediator between the two ends. This can be\r\ncentralizing due to two sided market dynamics or decentralizing due to\r\nready access to many intermediates and a reduction in trust invested\r\nin an endpoint.\r\n>\r\n> From a network perspective all devices transporting packets are\r\nintermediaries between the hosts that ultimately generate them. While\r\nencryption does reduce the possible intervention of these boxes,\r\nthere's quite a few cases where they do do things, and even without\r\ncentralization manage to undercut permissionless innovation.\r\n\r\n... and I replied:\r\n\r\n> I may have been infected by a legal/policy perspective that assumes a much broader definition of 'intermediation' -- will try to clarify to get everyone on the same page.",

And probably not completely matured in my head too (rough thoughts)\r\n\r\nOne feature to reduce centralization is the redundancy and/or duplication of a feature. Geo-Distributed Multiple servers make it easier to avoid the control by another entity at a different or in the same layer to control the system. If server A is down (for any reasons: technical, political, economic, etc.), re-routing to server B becomes a function of resilience, specifically if server A and server B are not controlled by the same political or economic entity. \r\n\r\nYou are mentioning this a bit in the notion of federated protocol and also the issue #11 has an impact on this. \r\nAka open standard format of data frees the data of being captured by a single entity that making them processable in a different context, by multiple clients, on multiple networks. It also makes the \"data redundant\" for the lack of a better word, aka having multiple copies of them in different locations and contexts (as opposed to a single point of failure such as a social network message with a unique URI for accessing it).\r\n\r\nAs you said all of that doesn't prevent centralization, but it encourages the possibility of decentralization.

What he insists upon, rather, is that the former relinquish one of their functions--the generation of mass loyalty.63 In complex modern societies, proposals for more highly decentralized and pluralistic decision making processes encounter two specific sorts of difficulties: On the one hand, they threaten to undermine concern for the common good on a broad territorial scale or the preservation of basic rights and liberties. These are the \"mischiefs of faction\" described by Madison in the Federalist Papers. On the other hand, they would also most likely weaken the possibility for accountable decision making with respect to any large-scale problems that arise within modern societies.64 Thus, rather than calling for the dismantling of the formal political system, Habermas has instead spoken of the need for secondary associations of the public sphere to surround and \"besiege\" it, without however conquering it.65 Although this metaphor is not particularly instructive for identifying the specific modes of exchange that should exist between institutions of the public sphere and the state, the basic intuition is relatively clear: The informal associations within civil society responsible for the production of solidarity should exercise an indirect influence upon the formal political system through the production of loyalties and legitimations; at the same time, however, the political system, including its territorially based form of representation, should provide appropriate mechanisms for accountable decision making and guarantee adequate concern for the common good of the republic as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis can also be seen as an argument against excessive decentralisation.",

For instance, due to lack of standards, it has been difficult to upgrade existing DNS servers to use DOH (albeit that is now being fixed in ADD), which lead to a situation where you have to be a party to a deal with Mozilla in order to get into their selected TRR list. Had both discovery and configuration been options from day one, then DOH deployment could have occurred both from the point of view of browsers pushing their model of TRRs *and* organic upgrades. As it was, more of the former happened. Of course there are many other factors as well (who wants to spend effort on DNS etc) but that's certainly one area where standards organizations could have helped. Removing gatekeepers is a useful service!\r\n\r\nAnd this isn't limited to DNS, of course, or even companies pushing their agendas and standards organizations being the good guys. Sometimes a standards organization has big players that want to keep a feature out so that they get to benefit from whatever current situation gives to them -- something which I recently encountered in an entirely different field. In that particular case it was important that architectures are flexible, components are pluggable, so that the standard organisations don't get to be too much of gatekeepers any more. I guess the flexibility of QUIC for new versions and new functionality is another example of this, something which we can perhaps benefit from in the future.\r\n\r\nObviously those discovery and flexibility mechanisms may also be misused.

I don't know that ADD _is_ the answer, in that letting a network interpose an intermediary removes much of the value of DoH.\r\n\r\nBack to this spec, I'm still struggling to see how it fits in. Discovery is one specific technology area that has impact on centralization, but there are many more -- e.g., identity. So far this draft doesn't go down to the level of exploring specific technological problems. It _could_ of course -- perhaps using DoH as a case study. I'm a bit concerned that it would make the draft more of a political football, however.\r\n\r\nThoughts?

As they say, hope is not a strategy.\r\n\r\nThis also calls to mind the law of conservation of attractive profits from Clayton Christensen, described in the HBR (Feb 2004):\r\n\r\n> Products are most profitable when they're still not \"good enough\" to satisfy consumers. This is because to make them performance competitive, engineers must use interdependent, proprietary architectures. Use of such architectures makes product differentiation straightforward, because each company pieces its parts together in a unique way.\r\n> \r\n> Once a product's performance _is_ good enough, companies must change the way they compete. The innovations for which customers will pay premium prices become speed to market and the ability responsively and conveniently to give customers exactly what they need, when they need it. To compete in this way, companies are forced to employ modular architectures for products. Modularity causes the products to become undifferentiable and commoditized. Attractive profits don't evaporate, however...\r\n> \r\n> They move elsewhere in the value chain, often to subsystems from which the modular product is assembled. This is because it is improvements in the subsystems, rather than the modular product's architecture, that drive the assembler's ability to move upmarket toward more attractive profit margins. Hence, the subsystems become decommoditized and attractively profitable. \r\n>\r\n> My sense is that these shifts are more than coincidental; I suspect that when most products start to become commoditized or modularized, this tum of events kick-starts a decommoditization process somewhere else in the value chain. As a general rule, one side of an interface in the value chain must be modular to allow the side that's not yet good enough to be optimized.\r\n>\r\n> My friend Chris Rowen, CEO of Tensilica, suggested that we call this phenomenon the law of conservation of attractive profits. (He was playing off the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, though it may be changed from one form to another.) Translated into managerial terms, the law goes something like this: When attractive profits disappear at one stage in the value chain because a product becomes modular and commoditized, the opportunity to earn attractive profits with proprietary products will usually emerge at an adjacent stage.\r\n\r\nAgain and again, we see proprietary efforts at establishing those modular architectures, so that the proponent can control the market. They're \"platforms\" but they're still centralized. The IETF has seen this story before: TCP was not the first or only network protocol, but the proprietary vendors moved on to other things when they realised the value was in a different place. I don't think we're going to convince the current crop to do likewise -- but we're not the only regulators in town any more.\r\n\r\nReturning to the issue -- I'll take this as a general one to expand upon federation some.",

Add to that SAML from OASIS.\r\n\r\nHere's another real life case the industry is facing today:\r\n\r\nGovernments are about to require software bills of material (SBOMs) to be delivered to customers in certain markets, and the industry is moving toward delivering that information.  But some producers want to authenticate recipients.  Now put yourself in a recipient's position, where you are monitoring perhaps 2,000 device types.  How to scale that such that the admin isn't constantly typing in credentials for different producers?  There are a few choices:\r\n\r\n - introduce a trusted aggregator service (there are a few of these)\r\n - use a federation to authenticate (there are a few of these)\r\n\r\nEach has pluses and minuses.

First, I **highly** recommend that you check out his and Steve Bellovin's views, as you may find them enlightening.  This goes to my earlier issues in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. Is the organizational model the one you want or might you take advantage of the timeliness of the DMA debate to think in different terms?\r\n\r\n2. Your point about reputation and email is **very** good and important; and goes to this interconnectivity versus interoperability aspect.  What is perhaps important is understanding the relationship between the protocol design and the governance model.  \r\n\r\nLet's take WhatsApp for example (this is what I mentioned to Eric).  They have a way cool approach to abuse reporting: and endpoint sends a message in the clear to a central authority who evaluates it and puts people on the naughty step if it is warranted.  It might be possible for WA to share those reports with other services.  That happens with email with DMARC and ARF, fur instance.  But the governance model is important as well.  Would you automatically send an abuse report to Eliot's Bar and Grill IM service without first reviewing it?  Would you accept an abuse report and take action from Eliot's Bar and Grill IM service without first reviewing it?\r\n\r\nObviously there are non-protocol aspects here, but the protocol developers need to recognize those as they are building out capabilities.",

The example I am trying to lay out is the converse: it is difficult to scale governance without some form of centralization.  Two examples:\r\n\r\n- Google can't just randomly credit ARF reports from anyone, because their data warehouse would be polluted (adversarial ML attack).\r\n- Were WhatsApp to take abuse reports about its users, it would need countermeasures to validate the authenticity of the message.  If such reports could come from anywhere, it would also offer a source of DDOS on the abuse system.\r\n\r\nBut there may be protocol operations that facilitate governance.  In the WA example, messages are/could be signed and thus validated.  If you bind that to an enforced code of practice, you can even apply violation codes to scale.\r\n\r\n",

I might call out \"benefits\" more directly, because it will help bring into focus the difficulty of the challenge.  Using an example here might help.  Here are two such:\r\n\r\n> The most significant environmental impact of computing is always at the edge.  Each watt expended by consumer gear such as laptops, smart phones, tablets, and routers is multiplied by millions if not billions.  The cost of environmental cost of production and disposal of each consumer device is similarly multiplied.  Each watt saved by use of some amount of centralization is conversely of huge societal benefit.  Everyone running their own SMTP local server would have a massive cost.\r\n\r\n> Similarly, the more distributed control, particularly to the users, requires more work by those same consumers to maintain and protect their components from vulnerabilities and exploits.  Some centralization absolves end users of those responsibilities. \r\n\r\n> The question then turns to how to balance this benefit against the risks.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings into question whether \"intermediaries\" in Section 6.4 is really the right term to use.  I don't have a better one offhand, tho.  Something on which to noodle?\r\n\r\nBy taking this approach, you express to the readers the seriousness and depth and respect that you treat the topic, and that it should demand of them.\r\n",

Sybil attacks typically affect systems in which the system state reflects the consensus of a majority of the \"participants\". The [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) correctly states \"A Sybil attack is a type of attack on a computer [network service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service) in which an attacker subverts the service's reputation system by creating a large number of [pseudonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymity) identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence.\"\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of \"proofs\" found in blockchain-based systems attempt to Sybil attack by only considering consensus among those pseudonymous entries that meet some condition. For example, systems based on \"proof of work\" require participants to consume a large quantity of energy before obtaining a \"vote\", and systems based on \"proof of stake\" only considers those participants that can \"stake\" a large quantity of some resource.",

I find the name to not match with what\u2019s described well. It\u2019s mainly about layering, and what a lower layer can do to force centralization on the layer above. Inheriting sounds more passive, whereas the example seems to require active interference of the lower layer.\r\n\r\nSection 2.2.5, \u201cPlatform centralization\u201d. Is this really a unique type of centralization? It may be, but I'm having trouble with how this is described. It\u2019s more just saying that a protocol might be used as part of a centralized solution, even when that protocol itself isn\u2019t centralized. The social networking example given here was supposedly also the \u201cconsolidation\u201d category already. It seems like there, the driver of centralization is consolidation, that just uses the platform. The platform here (HTTP) seems to be neutral to the centralization question \u2014 it neither encourages or discourages centralization.",

This implies that the standard is functionally complete and specified precisely enough to result in meaningful interoperability.\" This made me think of the consideration that regulators are giving right now to the costs of switching cloud providers.

I may have comments on that.\r\n\r\nThe main issue I see that consolidation does not imply centralization or vice versa, it's just a very common combination. And I thought I saw a few changes that seemed overly broad at first glance. I'll get back to you with something more meaningful than by previous blabber.",

Citing a book is a bit weird, but it's interesting IMHO how Zittrain's description of \"generative systems\" fits this point.\r\n1. IMHO in the federation section, the first line better refers to centralization than consolidation, because \"in Internet protocols\" follows, and that suggests a more architectural concern here.",
